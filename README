The bot works in Python 2.6+ and is probably completely broken in 3.x
Let's try to make it work in 3.x

The following non-standard Python modules need to be installed:

Python IRC Library
http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/

BeautifulSoup 3.2
http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/download/3.x/BeautifulSoup-3.2.0.tar.gz

MySQLdb (if you want to store and track URLs):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/files/mysql-python/1.2.3/MySQL-python-1.2.3.tar.gz/download


Remember to set your API keys and mysql/ident passwords
