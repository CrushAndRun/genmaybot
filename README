This is the Python 3.x branch - it might work in 2.x but I wouldn't try it.

The following non-standard Python modules need to be installed:

Python IRC Library
http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/
Note: A Python3 compatible port has been included in this repo

BeautifulSoup 4.1.0
http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/4.0/beautifulsoup4-4.1.0.tar.gz

MySQLdb (if you want to store and track URLs):
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/files/mysql-python/1.2.3/MySQL-python-1.2.3.tar.gz/download


Remember to set your API keys and mysql/ident passwords
