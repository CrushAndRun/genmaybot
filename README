This is the Python 3.x branch - it might work in 2.x but I wouldn't try it.

The following non-standard Python modules need to be installed:

Python IRC Library
http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/
Note: A Python3 compatible port has been included in this repo

BeautifulSoup 4.1.0
http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/4.0/beautifulsoup4-4.1.0.tar.gz

CherryPy is required

sqlite3 is required

Remember to set your API keys and ident password in the .cfg
